### Hi there, I'm Amanda! 👋

# Former personal trainer and youth worker turned Software Developer, I now develop websites with the goal to create applications that help our communities! I currently work with the MERN stack, and I love Frontend developement (but I'm constantly learning new technologies and skills). 

Here's some info about me: 

🔭 I’m currently working on building out a React application that displays a small business focused on marketing their photography. 
🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript and how to use it in my web applications.
🐶 I adopted my Husky mix in 2018 and we love going for hikes and any camping adventures!
